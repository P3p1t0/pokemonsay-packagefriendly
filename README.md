![You should try pokemonsay!](example.png)

`pokemonsay` is like [`cowsay`][cowsay] but for pokémon only. It was inspired by [`ponysay`][ponysay] (`cowsay` for ponies). Internally, `pokemonsay` still uses `cowsay`, so you need it installed too (`cowsay`... not `ponysay`).

This Github repository is based on rominzxx/pokemonsay (https://github.com/rominzxx/pokemonsay), which have a .cow file for every existing Pokémons. The main goal is to make pokemonsay easier to package for Arch-based distros. It may works for other package formats.
